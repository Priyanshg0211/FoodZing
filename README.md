# FoodZing Application README

## Introduction
Welcome to FoodZing! This is a project developed as part of Project 2 for learning basic implementation of Flutter. The main objective of this project is to apply fundamental Flutter concepts to create a functional application. In this project, we have utilized various Flutter widgets such as Rows, Columns, Stack, Scrollview, TextFormFields, ElevatedButton, and Bottom Navigation. The UI design was initially created using Figma and then implemented in Flutter.

## Features
- **Rows and Columns:** Utilized to organize UI elements horizontally and vertically.
- **Stack:** Used to overlay widgets on top of each other, such as images.
- **ScrollView:** Implemented to enable scrolling functionality for content overflow.
- **TextFormFields:** Employed for user input, specifically for email and password.
- **ElevatedButton:** Utilized to create interactive buttons with elevation.
- **Bottom Navigation:** Implemented for navigating between different screens within the application.

## Implementation Details
The project focuses on applying the learned Flutter concepts to create a functional application rather than solely concentrating on UI design. Each widget and functionality has been implemented with the aim of understanding and utilizing Flutter's capabilities effectively.

## Figma Design
The UI design for FoodZing was created using Figma, a collaborative interface design tool. It served as a blueprint for implementing the UI in Flutter, ensuring consistency and visual appeal throughout the application.

## How to Use
To run the FoodZing application:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Flutter installed and set up on your development environment.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
4. Run the application on an emulator or a physical device.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the Flutter community for providing excellent resources and documentation for learning and development. Also, gratitude to the creators of Figma for their intuitive design tool, which greatly facilitated the UI design process for this project.

Happy Coding!
